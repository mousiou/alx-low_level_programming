1. Like, comment, subscribe: Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
2. 0 > 972?: This program prints the largest of three integers.
Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
3. Leap year: This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
